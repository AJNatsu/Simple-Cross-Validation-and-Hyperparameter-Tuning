# Simple-Cross-Validation-and-Hyperparameter-Tuning
 The code simply demonstrates the process of fitting a Ridge regression model to predict outcomes based on polynomial features of input data, including data preparation, visualization, cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning, model training with an optimized hyperparameter, and evaluation
